Introduction

> _Our national flower is the concrete cloverleaf_.

The Automobiles and Engines Module is about applying our discussions of appropriate technologies and of the interplay between technology and culture to our own culture. The car is a relatively recent invention which reached its height of cultural saturation within our grandparent's generation. Since then, while the awareness of the role of cars in society has diminished, their impact has continued to grow.

The car is actually a system of interdependent mechanical technologies, within a larger system of interdependent social technologies. In taking apart an engine, we try to gain an appreciation for the precision engineering and innovative solutions that go into it. At the same time, we attempt to take apart the cultural ramifications of the car — including how it changed food, courtship, coming of age, and the city.

Today, the car is again a subject of debate. The rise of the car has come with endless problems, and yet a number of social and political forces have ensured its adoption. With the rise in gas prices, greater awareness of global warming, and the advent of new communication technologies, people are changing how they use cars and public transportation. At the same time, as we develop better planning technology, cities are re-thinking how to place limits on this technology.

Labs
----

The lab for the car module is to take apart a single-cylinder go-cart engine, and put it back together so that it works. These are precision instruments with a large number of parts, so students must be careful to catalog and keep safe everything as they disassemble it, but also to understand how each part of the engine works both individually and as a part of the whole.
